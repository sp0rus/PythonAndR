Nearly every dataset you run into is going to be one of three types.
- univariate data
    - one variable
    - usually you're looking at the distribution of the data, looking for trends
- bivariate data
    - two variables
    - looking at relationships between variables
- multivariate data
    - more than two variables
    - this is where you run into big challenges
    - you look for relationships between different combinations of data
        - which variables are relevant, not relevant, how relevant, etc


Steps to doing data anylysis

1. Clean the data
2. Extract a sample
3. Generate some plots
4. Make some assumptions on the data
5. Take a new sample: test set
6. Accept of reject the models
